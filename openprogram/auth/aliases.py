"""Provider alias table — short names users type on the CLI.

The canonical provider id is long and punctuated (``openai-codex``,
``google-gemini-cli``, ``github-copilot``) so the WebUI model picker
stays unambiguous. On the CLI though, people type what they say out
loud: ``codex``, ``claude``, ``gemini``, ``copilot``. This module
resolves those shortcuts.

Design:

* One-way alias → canonical. We never print the alias back; all output
  uses the canonical id so logs are unambiguous.
* Resolution is a pure function; no side effects, no registry mutation
  from user code.
* Aliases live here, not in each provider dir, so that conflicts are
  visible at review time (two providers can't claim the same alias
  without the conflict showing in one PR).

To add a new alias: edit :data:`_ALIASES`. That's it.
