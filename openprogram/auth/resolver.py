"""Single entry point callers use to resolve "the right credential, now".

The problem this solves: most call sites don't want to reason about
whether a provider uses OAuth, api_key, delegated-CLI, or env-var auth —
they just want a bearer string they can stick on the Authorization
header. :func:`resolve_api_key_sync` hides the ladder behind one call.

Resolution order:

  1. :func:`auth.context.get_credential_override` — lets tests or
     middleware inject a specific credential for this scope without
     writing the store.
  2. :meth:`AuthManager.acquire_sync` — the proper v2 path. Returns a
     refreshed access_token/api_key from the provider pool. If the
     provider isn't registered or the pool is empty, raises
     :class:`AuthConfigError`; we fall through rather than propagate.
  3. ``env_api_keys.get_env_api_key`` — legacy path that reads
     ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` etc. Kept because users with unmigrated setups
     still expect it to work.

Returns ``None`` if every step fails — caller decides whether that
triggers a "please log in" banner or just proceeds key-less (useful for
local model endpoints that don't need auth).

Intentionally sync: most provider call sites are sync (FastAPI
dependencies, CLI entry points). Async callers should call
:meth:`AuthManager.acquire` directly.
