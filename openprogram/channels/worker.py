"""Background-worker controls for ``openprogram channels start --detach``.

Design: channel polling lives in its own long-running process, not
inside the CLI chat or the Web UI. Reason — those are front-ends
(REPL, browser tabs) and should be spawnable / closeable at will.
Binding channel lifetime to any one of them means closing your chat
window kills the WeChat bot.

We reuse fcntl.flock via ``ChannelsLock``: only one worker can run
at a time, and ``read_holder_pid`` lets us answer "is it alive?"
from outside the worker.

Layout:
  <state>/channels.lock   — fcntl-locked PID file (written by ChannelsLock)
  <state>/channels.pid    — same PID, written by the worker on startup
                             and cleaned on exit. Independent of the
                             fcntl lock so `status` / `stop` work even
                             if the flock file is somehow busy.
  <state>/channels.log    — combined stdout + stderr

Start / stop semantics:
  start --detach        — fork, child execs `openprogram channels start`,
                          parent prints the new PID and returns.
  stop                  — SIGTERM the PID from channels.pid (or lock
                          file as fallback); waits up to 5s then reports.
  status                — queries the PID file + kill(pid, 0) liveness.

Naming: we call the background process a "worker" to line up with
``openprogram cron-worker``. The underlying POSIX concept is a
daemon, but user-facing text says worker everywhere for consistency.
