"""Runner for chat-channel bots.

Two entry points:

    run_all()  —  blocking. Used by `openprogram channels start`.
                   Starts every enabled+configured channel in a daemon
                   thread, waits for Ctrl-C, then shuts them down.

    start_all() — non-blocking. Used by `openprogram` (CLI chat) and
                   the Web UI to co-host channels alongside the main
                   REPL/server. Returns (stop_event, threads, lock).
                   Caller sets stop_event, joins threads, releases lock.

A process-wide exclusive fcntl lock (``ChannelsLock``) gates both: at
most one process pulls channel updates at a time. Multiple
``openprogram`` windows is a normal workflow (different conversations
in different terminals) — without the lock they'd race to
``getupdates`` and answer the same user message N times from N
unpredictable sessions.
