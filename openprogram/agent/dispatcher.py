"""Single entry point for every conversation turn.

Replaces the two ad-hoc paths that used to call ``runtime.exec(content)``
directly (channels worker + webui chat). Both now go through
``process_user_turn`` → ``agent_loop`` → tool dispatch + streaming
events broadcast as ``chat_response`` envelopes that any TUI / web /
future client subscribes to.

Architectural shape mirrors hermes' ``gateway/run.py:_run_agent``:
build context from durable session state, invoke the agent loop,
forward each emitted event to a broadcast hook, persist the final
turn. The TUI / web frontend doesn't know who triggered the turn —
the same ``chat_response`` envelope arrives whether a wechat message
came in or the user typed in PromptInput.

    Why a wrapper layer (vs. inspecting tool_execution_start in the
    drain): agent_loop schedules ``await tool.execute(...)`` directly
    after pushing tool_execution_start. The dispatcher's async-for
    consumer can't reliably block the tool from running because the
    tool already runs as a thread-pool task in parallel. Gating
    inside the tool's own coroutine is the only safe seam.
