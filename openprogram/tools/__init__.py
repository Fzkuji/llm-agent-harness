"""Tool registry.

Each tool lives under ``openprogram/tools/<name>/`` with at minimum:

    <name>/__init__.py exporting
        TOOL = {
            "spec": {"name", "description", "parameters"},
            "execute": callable | async callable,
        }

Optional metadata keys on the TOOL dict (all have safe defaults):

    "check_fn":             () -> bool      gate availability at runtime
    "requires_env":         list[str]       env vars required for the tool
                                             to function (e.g. API keys);
                                             `is_available` returns False
                                             when any are missing
    "max_result_size_chars": int             advisory truncation budget

Registration stays lazy — import only the tools you pass to
``runtime.exec(..., tools=...)`` or pick via ``get_many(toolset=...)``.
