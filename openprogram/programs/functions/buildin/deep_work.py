"""
deep_work — autonomous agent for complex, high-quality tasks.

For tasks that demand sustained effort and high standards (writing papers,
building features, investigating complex bugs), this function runs a
plan-execute-evaluate loop until the result meets the specified quality.

Flow:
  1. Clarify: analyze the task, ask the user any questions upfront
  2. Work: plan and execute steps autonomously (no more user interaction)
  3. Evaluate: the agent independently reviews its own output
  4. Revise: if evaluation fails, feed back and continue
  5. Repeat 2-4 until evaluation passes

Quality levels (from low to high):
  - high_school: basic correctness, simple structure
  - bachelor: solid understanding, proper methodology
  - master: depth of analysis, critical thinking, good writing
  - phd: novel contribution, rigorous methodology, publication-ready
  - professor: expert-level, authoritative, top-venue quality

Usage:
    from openprogram import create_runtime
    from openprogram.programs.functions.buildin.deep_work import deep_work

    runtime = create_runtime()

    result = deep_work(
        task="Write a survey paper on context management in LLM agents. "
             "Focus on compaction vs sub-agent trade-offs. Target NeurIPS workshop.",
