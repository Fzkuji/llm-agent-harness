"""Leaf LLM-callable tools.

Each subdirectory here holds one ``@function``-decorated tool —
deterministic Python whose body runs once per tool_call and returns
a result. No inner LLM rounds (that's what ``@agentic_function`` in
``../agentics/`` is for).

This package's only job is to side-effect-import every leaf tool on
load so the ``@function`` decorator's registration into the shared
``_registry`` fires before any consumer queries it. List order
doesn't matter; alphabetical for diff stability.
