"""LLM-friendly browser tool driven by the npm `agent-browser` package.

Sister tool to ``openprogram.functions.tools.browser`` (the Playwright-direct one).
This one delegates to ``npx agent-browser`` so the ariaSnapshot + ref-ID
abstraction (``@e1`` ``@e2`` element ids) lands in the LLM's hands
without us reimplementing it.
