"""Function calling — registry, presets, policy.

Every function the LLM can call is decorated with ``@function`` (see
``_runtime.py``). The decorator builds an ``AgentTool`` and registers
it into a single in-process registry; this module imports each
subpackage so the side-effect registrations fire at import time, then
exposes the resolution API (presets, allow/deny/source policy chain).

Design synthesizes three external frameworks under ``references/``:

  - Claude Code: the ``AgentTool`` shape, the
    ``execute(call_id, args, cancel, on_update) -> AgentToolResult``
    contract, and the search/read collapse semantics.
  - Hermes: ``TOOLSETS`` with ``{tools, includes}`` composition,
    ``_expand_preset`` recursive walk + first-occurrence dedupe.
  - OpenClaw: per-channel ``unsafe_in`` filtering, allow/deny chain
    layered on top of the toolset (``apply_tool_policy``).

Beyond the references we add a dynamic per-call result ceiling, an
LLM-controllable timeout, a bounded streaming on_update accumulator,
and ``can_use()`` pre-flight gates — all wired through ``@function``
kwargs. See ``_runtime.py`` for the decorator and the helpers it
relies on.
