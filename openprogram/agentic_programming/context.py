"""
Context — execution record for Agentic Functions.

The Big Picture:
    Every @agentic_function call creates a Context node. Nodes form a tree
    via parent/children links. The tree is a COMPLETE, IMMUTABLE record of
    everything that happened during execution.

    Two concerns, fully separated:

    1. RECORDING — automatic, unconditional. Every function call gets a node.
       All parameters, outputs, errors, LLM I/O are captured. Nothing is
       ever deleted or modified after recording.

    2. READING — on-demand, selective. When a function needs to call an LLM,
       summarize() queries the tree and returns a text string containing
       only the relevant parts. What to include is configured per-function
       via the @agentic_function decorator's `summarize` parameter.

    This separation means:
    - Recording is never affected by how data is read later
    - Different functions can read the SAME tree differently
    - The full history is always available for debugging/saving

Tree Example:
    root
    ├── navigate("login")                   → root/navigate_0
    │   ├── observe("find login")           → root/navigate_0/observe_0
    │   │   ├── run_ocr(img)                → root/navigate_0/observe_0/run_ocr_0
    │   │   └── detect_all(img)             → root/navigate_0/observe_0/detect_all_0
    │   ├── act("click login")              → root/navigate_0/act_0
    │   └── verify("check result")          → root/navigate_0/verify_0
    └── navigate("settings")                → root/navigate_1
        └── ...

    Paths are auto-computed: {parent_path}/{name}_{index_among_same_name_siblings}

        Read from the Context tree and produce a text string for LLM input.

        This is the ONLY way Context data flows into LLM calls.
        runtime.exec() calls this automatically using the decorator's config.

        Default behavior (all defaults):
            - Shows ALL ancestors (root → parent chain)
            - Shows ALL same-level siblings that completed before this node
            - Does NOT show siblings' children (each sibling is one line)
            - Does NOT show the current node itself

        This default guarantees maximum prompt cache hit rate: every call
        sees the previous call's context as a prefix, plus new content
        appended at the end.

        Args:
            depth:      How many ancestor levels to show.
                        -1 = all (default), 0 = none, 1 = parent only, N = up to N levels.

            siblings:   How many previous siblings to show.
                        -1 = all (default), 0 = none, N = last N siblings.
                        When N is set, keeps the N most recent (closest to current).

            level:      Override render level for ALL nodes in the output.
                        If None, each node uses its own `render` setting.
                        Values: "trace" / "detail" / "summary" / "result" / "silent"

            include:    Path whitelist. Only show nodes whose path matches.
                        Supports * wildcard: "root/navigate_0/*" matches all children.

            exclude:    Path blacklist. Hide nodes whose path matches.
                        Supports * wildcard.

            branch:     List of node names whose children should be expanded.
                        By default, siblings are shown as one line (no children).
                        branch=["observe"] would expand observe nodes to show
                        their run_ocr/detect_all children.
                        Respects compress: compressed nodes are NOT expanded.

            max_tokens: Approximate token budget for sibling context. When exceeded,
                        drops the oldest siblings first. The current call block is
                        always preserved. Uses len(text)/4 as token estimate.

        Returns:
            A string ready to be injected into an LLM prompt.
            Empty string if nothing to show.

        Examples:
            ctx.summarize()                              # see everything (default)
