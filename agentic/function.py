@agentic_function — decorator that auto-tracks function execution in the Context tree.

This is the ONLY thing users need to add to their code. Everything else is automatic.
The decorator intercepts function calls, creates Context nodes, and manages the tree.

Usage:
    @agentic_function
    def observe(task):
        '''Look at the screen...'''
        img = take_screenshot()
        return runtime.exec(prompt=observe.__doc__, input={"task": task}, images=[img])

    @agentic_function(expose="detail", context="inherit")
    def act(target, location):
        '''Click the target.'''
        click(location)
        return {"clicked": True}

Design decisions (lessons learned):

    1. We tried THREE approaches for how functions access their Context:
       - v1: Pass ctx as argument → users can pass wrong ctx, error-prone
       - v2: get_context() inside function → extra boilerplate, ugly
       - v3: Users don't touch ctx at all → WINNER. Zero framework code in user functions.
       The key insight: if runtime.exec() auto-records to Context, users never need ctx.

    2. The `context` parameter controls tree attachment:
       - "auto": creates root if needed (most common, zero setup)
       - "new": independent tree (for background tasks)
       - "inherit": must be called from another agentic function (enforced)
       - "none": skip tracking entirely (pure Python, no overhead)
       We added "auto" root creation after Codex review pointed out that
       without init_root(), the Context tree was lost after execution.

    3. expose is a RENDERING HINT passed to Context.summarize().
       It is NOT a security boundary — summarize(level=...) can override it.
       We debated calling it "visibility" or "share_level" but kept "expose"
       for brevity. The Codex reviewer flagged this naming as ambiguous.

    4. async def is NOT supported yet. Decorating an async function will
       silently produce wrong results (coroutine stored as output).
       TODO: Either support async properly or reject at decoration time.
