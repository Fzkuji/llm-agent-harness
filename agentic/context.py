"""
Context — the execution record for one Agentic Function call.

Architecture:
    All function calls form a single tree. Each node is a Context.
    The tree is a COMPLETE RECORD of everything that happened.
    When feeding context to an LLM, summarize() QUERIES the tree selectively.
    
    Record and query are fully separated:
    - What gets recorded is NOT affected by queries
    - What gets queried does NOT affect the record

Tree structure example:
    root
    ├── navigate("login")
    │   ├── observe("find login")       → root/navigate_0/observe_0
    │   │   ├── run_ocr(img)            → root/navigate_0/observe_0/run_ocr_0
    │   │   └── detect_all(img)         → root/navigate_0/observe_0/detect_all_0
    │   ├── observe("find password")    → root/navigate_0/observe_1
    │   └── act("login", [347, 291])    → root/navigate_0/act_0
    └── navigate("settings")
        └── ...

Key design decisions (lessons learned):
    1. We use contextvars.ContextVar for implicit call-stack tracking.
       Users never pass ctx manually — the decorator handles everything.
       We tried explicit ctx passing first, but it was error-prone.
    
    2. summarize() is a flexible tree query, NOT a fixed format.
       It supports depth, siblings, include/exclude paths, branch selection.
       Earlier versions had a rigid sibling_summaries() that only looked
       at immediate siblings — too limiting for complex call trees.
    
    3. Each node has an auto-computed path (e.g. "root/navigate_0/observe_1").
       Paths use {name}_{index} where index counts same-name siblings.
       This enables precise addressing in complex trees with repeated calls.
    
    4. expose is a RENDERING HINT, not a security policy.
       summarize(level=...) can override any node's expose setting.
       If you need real isolation, use @agentic_function(context="none").
    
    5. input/media/raw_reply are currently single fields (one LLM call per node).
       TODO: Change to llm_calls: list[LLMCall] to support multiple
       runtime.exec() calls within one function. This is a known limitation.

# ======================================================================
# ContextPolicy — controls what context gets injected into LLM calls
# ======================================================================
#
# The core problem: every function in the tree needs DIFFERENT context.
#   - Orchestrator: sees all children's results (big picture)
#   - Planner: sees recent observations + parent goal
#   - Worker (observe/act): sees last few siblings, not ancient history
#   - Leaf (OCR): sees nothing — pure computation
#
# Two additional concerns beyond "how much":
#   1. FRESHNESS: When called 20 times, old siblings become stale.
#      Recency decay controls this — more siblings → fewer visible.
#   2. CACHE STABILITY: For prompt caching ($0.50 vs $5.00/MTok),
#      the rendered text of old siblings must NEVER change.
#      Once rendered, it's frozen — even if decay would change the level.
#
# Design evolution:
#   v1: No policy — summarize() always showed everything. Expensive, noisy.
#   v2: Manual summarize() params per call-site. Flexible but tedious.
#   v3: ContextPolicy object — declare once on the decorator, auto-applied.
#       Presets for common patterns (ORCHESTRATOR, PLANNER, WORKER, LEAF).

            max_tokens:   Approximate token budget. Drops oldest siblings first.
            max_siblings: Shorthand for siblings=N (legacy compat)
            depth:        Ancestor visibility. -1=all, 0=none, 1=parent only, 2=grandparent...
            siblings:     Sibling visibility. -1=all, 0=none, N=last N siblings
            include:      Path whitelist. Only show matching nodes. Supports * wildcard.
                          e.g. ["root/navigate_0/observe_1", "root/navigate_0/observe_1/*"]
            exclude:      Path blacklist. Hide matching nodes. Supports * wildcard.
                          e.g. ["root/navigate_0/observe_0"]
            branch:       Show entire subtree under nodes with these names.
                          e.g. ["observe"] shows observe + all its children (run_ocr, detect_all)
