"""SessionDB cross-process concurrency.

Multiple SessionDB instances on the same sqlite file simulate multi-
process deployments (gunicorn workers + channels worker + TUI all
attached). Each instance opens its own connection, so SQLite WAL's
file-level locking is what we're actually testing — not Python's
GIL.

What must hold under contention:
  - No "database is locked" leaks past _execute_write's retry layer
  - All writes from all processes land (no lost updates)
  - Readers see writes from other processes
