/**
 * OpenProgram TUI Kit — opinionated component library on top of
 * vendored ink.
 *
 * Layers:
 *   Layer 0  vendored ink (DOM): Box, Text, ScrollBox, AlternateScreen,
 *            useInput, etc. — exported from '@openprogram/ink'.
 *   Layer 1  this kit: app-shell, layout, modal, form, feedback. Use
 *            these in screens; do NOT mix with raw ink primitives in
 *            new code (existing screens migrate gradually).
 *   Layer 2  screens (REPL, demo): consume layer 1.
 *
 * Phase 1 surface: enough to migrate REPL off main-buffer flow and
 * fix the resize bugs. Subsequent phases add Modal, Form, Toast.
